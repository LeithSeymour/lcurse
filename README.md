lcurse
======

Python script to have a "curse" compatible client for linux


lcurse nowadays supports git repositories too.
As git repos aren't structured the same, you will most probably need to create an link via "ln -s source destination" inside the wow/Interface/Addons folder.
But at least the update is then done via the usuall lcurse way.
